				<h3>About me</h3>

				<p>Well I am a arab teen how learnt how to code at a yound age, I was always into computers, my intrest started with mostly graphics design and photoshop which involved a lot of cracking as I couldn't really want to speand any money on a suit of programs when I only use one for really non impertant reasons. I eventually learnt python with the goal of hacking something, really anything...</p>
				
				<h2>Using code to my advantage is a constant goal</h2>

				<p> Making dumb viruses is my thing, and it is how mainly started, NOT_A_VIRUS is my first creation and is still my favorite to this day… and more recently lice_mal with a more complex file damaging approach. Both target very slow and unprotected computers (just like ones you would find at schools…)</p> 
				
				<p>I’ve done lots with my skills, ranging from web scraping to Minecraft “hacking”. Needless to say all my projects have been to make life easier while improving my programming skills.</p>
